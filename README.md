#### Q1. What is the importance of writing clean code?

- [ ] It makes the code faster.
- [x] It improves code readability and maintainability.
- [ ] It eliminates the need for testing.
- [ ] It reduces the size of the codebase.

<div id="how_can_you_ensure_that_your_code_is_readable_and_understandable"  />

#### Q2. How can you ensure that your code is readable and understandable?

- [ ] By using complex algorithms and data structures.
- [ ] By minimizing comments to keep the code concise.
- [x] By following naming conventions and using descriptive names.
- [ ] By avoiding any form of code refactoring.

<div id="what_is_the_significance_of_writing_self_explanatory_code"  />

#### Q3. What is the significance of writing self-explanatory code?

- [ ] It saves time during code reviews.
- [ ] It eliminates the need for unit testing.
- [ ] It improves code performance.
- [x] It reduces the cognitive load on developers.

<div id="what_is_the_purpose_of_code_formatting_and_indentation"  />

#### Q4. What is the purpose of code formatting and indentation?

- [ ] It is purely a matter of personal preference
- [ ] It reduces the file size of the code.
- [x] It improves code readability and understanding.
- [ ] It ensures code compatibility with different programming languages.

<div id="what_is_the_purpose_of_code_comments"  />

#### Q5. What is the purpose of code comments?

- [ ] To make the code more confusing.
- [ ] To explain every line of code in detail.
- [x] To provide additional information that is not evident from the code itself.
- [ ] To replace the need for writing self-explanatory code.

<div id="what_is_the_purpose_of_the_Boy_Scout_Rule"  />

#### Q6. What is the purpose of the "Boy Scout Rule"?

- [ ] Always leave the code worse than you found it.
- [ ] Refactor the code only if it is completely broken.
- [x] T Improve the code a little bit whenever you touch it.
- [ ] Avoid making any changes to the existing codebase.

<div id="what_are_the_solid_principles_of_object_oriented_design"  />

#### Q7. What are the SOLID principles of object-oriented design?

- [ ] Simple, Optimized, Logical, Integrated, Dynamic.
- [ ] Structured, Organized, Layered, Independent, Decoupled.
- [ ] Single, Open, Liskov, Interface, Dependency.
- [x] Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion.

<div id="how_does_the_single_responsibility_principle_srp_contribute_to_clean_code"  />

#### Q8. How does the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) contribute to clean code?

- [ ] It ensures that a class has only one method.
- [ ] It limits the number of lines of code in a module.
- [ ] It restricts the use of inheritance in object-oriented design.
- [x] It ensures that a class has only one reason to change.

<div id="explain_the_open-closed_principle_ocp_and_its_benefits"  />

#### Q9. Explain the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) and its benefits

- [x] It states that software entities should be open for modification and closed for extension.
- [ ] It promotes the use of global variables for easy code maintenance.
- [ ] It suggests that code should be rewritten from scratch for each new requirement.
- [ ] It encourages tightly-coupled modules to achieve better performance.

<div id="how_can_you_handle_error_conditions_and_exceptions_in_your_code"  />

#### Q10. How can you handle error conditions and exceptions in your code?

- [ ] Ignore the errors and hope they won't occur.
- [ ] Use global error handlers to catch all exceptions.
- [x] Handle errors locally and provide meaningful error messages.
- [ ] Avoid using exception handling altogether.

<div id="how_can_you_effectively_name_variables_functions_and_classes"  />

#### Q11. How can you effectively name variables, functions, and classes?
